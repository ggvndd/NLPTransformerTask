# Transformer Architecture Implementation Report
**Individual Assignment - Natural Language Processing**

## 1. Architecture Design Overview

This implementation features a complete GPT-style decoder-only Transformer architecture built from scratch using only NumPy. The design follows the "Attention is All You Need" paper principles with modern improvements like pre-normalization.

### Core Components Implemented:
- **Token Embedding**: Learnable lookup table mapping token IDs to dense vectors
- **Positional Encoding**: Sinusoidal encoding for sequence position awareness
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Scaled dot-product attention with 8 parallel heads
- **Feed-Forward Network**: Two-layer MLP with GELU activation
- **Layer Normalization**: Pre-norm architecture for better gradient flow
- **Causal Masking**: Lower triangular mask preventing future token access
- **Output Layer**: Linear projection to vocabulary with softmax distribution

## 2. Positional Encoding Choice: Sinusoidal

**Rationale for Sinusoidal over Learned Encoding:**

1. **Parameter Efficiency**: No additional learnable parameters required
2. **Extrapolation Capability**: Can handle sequences longer than training data
3. **Mathematical Properties**: 
   - PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
   - PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
   - Enables relative position computation through linear combinations

4. **Stability**: Fixed encoding prevents overfitting to position patterns

## 3. Causal Masking Implementation

**Purpose & Implementation:**
```python
def create_causal_mask(seq_len: int) -> np.ndarray:
    mask = np.triu(np.ones((seq_len, seq_len)), k=1)
    return mask == 0  # True where attention is allowed
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Autoregressive Constraint**: Token at position i can only attend to positions ≤ i  
- **Information Flow**: Prevents future information leakage during training
- **Decoder Architecture**: Essential for GPT-style language modeling
- **Mathematical Effect**: Sets attention scores to -∞ for masked positions before softmax

## 4. Testing & Validation Results

### Tensor Dimension Verification:
```
✅ Token Embeddings: [batch_size, seq_len] → [batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim]
✅ Attention Weights: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len] 
✅ Model Output: [batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size]
✅ Next Token Probabilities: [batch_size, vocab_size]
```

### Mathematical Property Validation:
```
✅ Softmax Probabilities: Sum = 1.000000 (verified)
✅ Causal Mask: Upper triangle = -∞ (verified) 
✅ Layer Normalization: Mean ≈ 0, Variance ≈ 1 (verified)
✅ Attention Weights: Row sums = 1.0 (verified)
```

### Functional Testing:
```
✅ Forward Pass: Input tokens → Output logits (successful)
✅ Text Generation: Autoregressive sampling (working)
✅ Component Integration: All modules compatible (verified)
✅ Gradient Flow Simulation: Stable transformations (confirmed)
```
